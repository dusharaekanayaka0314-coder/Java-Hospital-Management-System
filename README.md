# Java-Hospital-Management-System

Added NetBeans hospital management system
Java Hospital Management System – First Year OOP Project

This project is a desktop-based Hospital Management System developed using Java and Object-Oriented Programming concepts. The system is designed to simulate real hospital operations including patient registration, appointment scheduling, billing, medical records, and staff management.

The application demonstrates core OOP principles such as abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Data is stored and retrieved using file handling techniques instead of databases, making it suitable for beginner-level learning and academic purposes. There are several areas that can be improved in future versions, such as UI design, database integration, and advanced validation.
This project represents my learning progress and foundation in software development.

Key features include
• Patient record management
• Appointment scheduling system
• Medical report handling
• Billing and charge calculation
• Staff and administrator management
• File-based persistent data storage

Technologies used
- Java
- Swing GUI
- NetBeans IDE
- File handling (text files)

This project was developed as a solo first-year academic assignment to strengthen understanding of Java fundamentals, OOP design, and file handling.
